## 🚀 How to Use with GitHub Copilot

### Step 1: Start CodeMind Server

The server will start automatically when VS Code loads if configured in settings.json.

**Manual start** (for testing):
```powershell
D:/Projects/Python/CodeMind/.venv/Scripts/python.exe codemind.py
```

### Step 2: Add to VS Code Settings

Add this to your `.vscode/settings.json` or User Settings:

```json
{
  "github.copilot.advanced": {
    "mcp": {
      "servers": {
        "codemind": {
          "command": "D:/Projects/Python/CodeMind/.venv/Scripts/python.exe",
          "args": ["D:/Projects/Python/CodeMind/codemind.py"],
          "env": {}
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Restart VS Code

Close and reopen VS Code completely for MCP configuration to take effect.

### Step 4: Verify It's Working

Open GitHub Copilot Chat and type:
```
@codemind can you help me?
```

Or simply start asking questions that require codebase knowledge:
```
Search the codebase for authentication code
Check if we already have caching implemented
Find all database query patterns
```

## 💬 Example Prompts for GitHub Copilot

### Before Adding Features
```
Before I create a new payment processing module, can you search 
the existing code to see if we already have payment functionality?
```

### During Refactoring
```
I need to refactor the database layer. Can you find all the files 
that interact with the database and show me the current patterns?
```

### While Debugging
```
We're getting 500 errors on the API. Can you search for error 
handling code and logging to help me trace the issue?
```

### For Code Review
```
I'm reviewing a PR that adds Redis caching. Can you check if we 
already have caching anywhere and show me our configuration patterns?
```

### Architecture Planning
```
We're considering splitting the payment service into a microservice. 
Can you find all payment-related code and database dependencies?
```

### Learning the Codebase
```
I'm new to this project. Can you show me the main entry points, 
data models, and test patterns?
```

## 🎯 Agent Prompt for Maximum Effectiveness

See **[AGENT_PROMPT.md](./AGENT_PROMPT.md)** for the complete system prompt that makes AI agents use CodeMind effectively.

**Key principles**:
1. ✅ **Always search before building** - prevents duplicate code
2. ✅ **Record all decisions** - creates institutional knowledge
3. ✅ **Use specific queries** - better search results
4. ✅ **Check for existing patterns** - maintains consistency

---

## 🔧 Tool Reference

| Tool | When to Use | Example Query |
|------|------------|---------------|
| `check_functionality_exists` | Before adding features | "user authentication with JWT tokens" |
| `search_existing_code` | Find similar code | "database connection pooling sqlite" |
| `get_file_context` | Understand specific file | "path/to/file.py" |
| `record_decision` | After decisions | Description + reasoning + files |
| `query_recent_changes` | Code review context | Last 24-168 hours |

---

## 📊 Performance Characteristics

**Initialization**: < 2 seconds (fast startup with lazy scanning)
**First query**: 5-20 seconds (scans project on first use)
**Subsequent queries**: < 1 second (uses cached data)
**Semantic search**: Powered by sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
**Database**: SQLite with indexed queries

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start
```powershell
# Check if dependencies installed
D:/Projects/Python/CodeMind/.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pip list

# Should see: fastmcp, sentence-transformers, numpy
```

### VS Code Can't Connect
1. Check VS Code logs: `Output → MCP Servers`
2. Verify path in settings.json is correct
3. Restart VS Code completely

### Slow First Query
This is normal! CodeMind scans your project on first use. Subsequent queries are fast.

### No Results Found
- Use more specific, multi-word queries
- Include technology names (e.g., "fastapi route" not just "route")
- Try broader keywords if too specific

---

## 📈 Next Steps

1. ✅ **Server is tested and working**
2. ✅ **Agent prompt created**
3. ⏳ **Add to VS Code settings** (you need to do this)
4. ⏳ **Restart VS Code**
5. ⏳ **Test with GitHub Copilot**

---

## 🎉 Success Criteria

You'll know CodeMind is working when:
- ✅ Copilot stops suggesting duplicate code
- ✅ Copilot follows existing patterns automatically
- ✅ Copilot can answer "does this exist?" questions
- ✅ Copilot references past architectural decisions
- ✅ Code reviews become more thorough and consistent
