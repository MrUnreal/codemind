"Find all TODO comments and check if any relate to testing"
"Analyze code metrics and show me the most complex files"
```

### Be Specific:
```
‚ùå "Tell me about this codebase"
‚úÖ "Search for existing error handling code and show me usage examples"
```

### Use Context:
```
"Before I create a new parser function, check if similar functionality exists"
"I want to refactor get_workspace_db - what would break?"
```
